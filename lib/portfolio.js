    description: 'HelloBacker was my internship project while working at Made \
    by Many. Together with two other interns I was tasked to build a \
    launch-ready product from the ground-up in twelve weeks. HelloBacker is \
    the result of that effort. As the software developer on our team, I built \
    the entire thing from scratch and was responsible for all technical and \
    architectural decisions. I built the app using React and Alt as a \
    single-page app front-end. The back-end is powered by Express and \
    Bookshelf, an ORM that sits atop a PostgreSQL database.',

    On my own, I also created an interactive web version which focuses on \
    drought trends in the United States from 2000 to the present day. I used \
    Python and R to scrape and analyze the data, and then used the D3 Framework \
    and Adobe Illustrator to render the final visualizations.',
